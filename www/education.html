            <p>
                I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.
                I feel like I've excelled in my work here, and I've learned a lot.
                <br>
                The University of Central Florida is a fantastic university with an amazing Computer Science
                program. I feel like the program has nurtured my love for computer science
                and software development. I also took the time to take electives in low-level computing because
                I was fascinated by it.
