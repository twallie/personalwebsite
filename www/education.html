        <h3>I love learning.</h3>
        <p>
            I have always had a deep love for learning, and it's something that influences most of my actions.
            I found that challenging myself academically was the best way to learn more things, so I did it often.
            Across my entire life, I've continued to learn more and more things.

        <h3>I've learned a lot.</h3>
        <p>
            My love of learning has caused me to learn a lot of things, and I'm proud of the things I know.
            <br>I'm a fluent programmer with several languages, primarily Java, Python, and C.
            <br>I invite you to take a look at the <a>courses</a> page, as you can see all the classes I took at my University.
